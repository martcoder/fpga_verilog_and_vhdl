- Signals must have  a type declaration, types are defined in libraries, ususlaly IEEE or WORK (work is default so never needs to be written). 

- Binary example: B"11001010";    or alternatively using base: 2#11001010#;
- Hex example: X"F6";       or alternatively using base:   16#F6#;
NB using underscores within the value itself can improve readability and is allowed :)

- Integer example: constant FREEZE : integer := 32; 


-IMPORTANT LIBRARIES:  library IEEE; and sub libraries std_logic_1164 and numeric_std    
- example of how to start VHDL code file: 
library IEEE;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all; 

Use unsigned or signed data types rather than std_logic_vector whenever possible!
